"""
Result extraction from a solved solph model into tsib's result shape.

solph's own `processing.results()` returns a flow-centric nested dict, which
is the right structure for generic post-processing but not what tsib's
building result handling (CSV export, TinyDB cache, static results) expects.
This module bridges the two without replacing either.

    Solves an energy system with tsib's solver handling.

    Deliberately not `solph.Model.solve()`: the 5R1C model is numerically
    badly conditioned (glpk fails on it outright, HiGHS needs the interior
    point method with crossover switched off), and that tuning lives in
    `solverutils.manageSolverOpts`. `solph.Model` is a pyomo ConcreteModel,
    so the tsib solver path applies to it unchanged.
