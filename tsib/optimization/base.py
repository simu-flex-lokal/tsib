"""
Base classes for custom solph components.

Almost nothing in tsib needs these: every component of the building block
kit (grid, PV, storage, heat pump, demand, metering) maps onto a stock solph
object and is built by a `@factory` in `registry.py`. A custom component is
only necessary when the physics is not expressible as flows between buses -
free state variables, coupled algebraic nodes, bounds on something that is
not a flow. The 5R1C thermal zone is the only such case.

A custom component is always two classes that have to find each other:

  * a **node** (`TsibComponent`) that hangs in the energy system graph and
    carries the parameterization;
  * a **block** (`TsibBlock`) that holds the pyomo variables and constraints,
    created once for all nodes of that type.

`constraint_group()` on the node is the link: it returns the block class,
and solph instantiates that block while assembling the model.

Deriving from these bases rather than from `Node`/`ScalarBlock` directly
buys two things: `CONSTRAINT_GROUP` is inherited instead of being repeated
(see `assert_constraint_groups` for why its absence is so costly), and the
abstract methods make a half-implemented component fail at instantiation
rather than at solve time.

    with `hasattr(i, "CONSTRAINT_GROUP")`. Note that the test is for
    existence, not for truth - setting it to False does not switch anything
    off, it only obscures the intent.

    Raises if a custom component's block would be ignored by solph.

    Without `CONSTRAINT_GROUP` on the block, solph skips it in silence: the
    model builds, the solver reports optimality, and the component imposes
    no constraints whatsoever. Deriving the block from `TsibBlock` makes
    that unreachable, but nothing stops a component from subclassing
    `ScalarBlock` directly, so the guard is checked on every built system.

    Stock solph blocks are exempt because they never take the `hasattr`
    path: `Model.CONSTRAINT_GROUPS` already lists them, and the attribute
    scan only collects the custom blocks on top of that list.
